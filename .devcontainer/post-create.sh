# EROFS. Drop the symlinks; mkdir -p below recreates them as real
# directories in the named volume.

# Plugins, skills, agents, memory, commands, settings.json, $HOME/.claude.json,
# Codex config.toml/memories/skills are all RW bind-mounted directly from
# host in devcontainer.json — they live on host and reads/writes go
# bidirectionally. Nothing for this script to do for those.
#
# What stays per-container (in the named volume) and gets SYNCED from
# host on container-create:
#   - .credentials.json (Claude OAuth tokens)
#   - .claude/.claude.json (Claude identity: userID, oauthAccount,
#     migration tracking — different file from $HOME/.claude.json)
#   - auth.json (Codex)
#   - cli-config.json (Cursor — conflates auth + settings)
#
# Sync semantics: ALWAYS overwrite from host on container-create, so a
# fresh container starts logged in as host's user (if host had creds).
# Container manages its own refresh from there until next rebuild.
# Logging out in container doesn't affect host. Per-container login is
# the design goal; bind-mounting these would make logout shared.
