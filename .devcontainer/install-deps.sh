# Devcontainer updateContentCommand — runs on container-create AND whenever
# workspace content changes (lockfile updates etc., per the Dev Container
# spec). Handles workspace dependency installation only; AI CLI state sync
# lives in post-create.sh which runs once after this.
#
# Why split out: `updateContentCommand` re-runs on content updates, while
# `postCreateCommand` runs only on container-create. Putting `npm install`
# here means a rebuild after pulling new dependencies refreshes them
# without re-running the AI CLI credential/path-translation work each time.
